## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements like :hover, :last-child, and ::marker. I also used the > selector for direct selection.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.preparation ul li::marker {
  color: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
}
section ul,
ol li {
  padding: 5px 0px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to use UI frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap for CSS in the future. I also want to use more pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in my CSS code.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for HTML tag.
- [W3Shools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for CSS selector and pseudo element and classes.
